WIRING DIAGRAM (TEXT)

Battery (4S LiPo 14.8V) -> Main fuse -> Power switch
  |-> Motor drivers (x2) -> Left/Right motors
  |-> Buck 12V -> LiDAR / 12V accessories
  `-> Buck 5V  -> Raspberry Pi / Arduino / sensors

Control:
- Arduino (MCU) -> Motor drivers (PWM + direction)
- Raspberry Pi -> Arduino (USB/UART) for high-level control
- Sensors -> Pi/Arduino as appropriate

Notes:
- Add a common ground between all modules
- Use separate fuses for high-current motor lines
